-- # write your SQL statement here: you are given a table 'removechar' with column 's', return a table with column 's' and your result in a column named 'res'.
-- It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. 
-- You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

select s, substring(s, 2, length(s) - 2) as res from removechar;
