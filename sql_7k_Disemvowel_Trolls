--  DESCRIPTION:
--  Trolls are attacking your comment section!
--  A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
--  Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
--  For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
--  Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION got(str VARCHAR)
RETURNS VARCHAR AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN regexp_replace(str, '[AEIOYaeiouy]', '', 'g');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

select str, got(str) as res from disemvowel;
