-- For this challenge you need to create a UNION statement, there are two tables ussales and eusales the parent company tracks each sale at its respective location in each table, 
-- you must all filter the sale price so it only returns rows with a sale greater than 50.00.
-- You have been tasked with combining that data for future analysis. Order by location (US before EU), then by id.
